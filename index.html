        <h3>Introduction.</h3>

<p>Welcome to the course material for the DIBI 2012 Workshop, Introduction to Ruby on Rails. This contains a handy setup guide, to be completed before the day of the workshop, a run through of some of the important concepts that will be covered, and links off to external resources that are useful for more information and may go into a little more depth.</p>

<h3>0. Setup a Rails Development Environment</h3>

<p>Setting up your environment can be difficult when starting with Ruby on Rails. There‘s a lot to take on board before you even get started. To make things easy for you, and to ensure that you have everything you need to follow along with the workshop, we have created a Virtual Machine image with the correct setup using popular, open-source tools. You’ll need to download VirtualBox, Vagrant and a Vagrant Box that we have created. Don’t worry, this is quite straight forward and is designed to work on all major platforms: Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">Download VirtualBox 4.1.12</a> for your platform and install it.</li>
  <li><a href="http://downloads.vagrantup.com/tags/v1.0.2">Download Vagrant 1.0.2</a> for your platform and install it.<br>More detailed instructions are available in the <a href="http://vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/index.html">Vagrant Documentation</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You should now be ready to set up your box. To do so, run the following commands in Terminal or your command prompt. It’s a good idea to create a new directory/folder to work from.</p>

<p><strong>Beginners Tip:</strong> <em>Type each line at your prompt (without the $) and hit the Return Key.</em></p>
<pre><code>$ vagrant box add dibirails /path/to/box
$ vagrant init dibirails
$ vagrant up
</code></pre>
<p>This should fire up a virtual machine in the background running our Rails development environment in Ubuntu. You can test that everything is working properly by logging into the machine:</p>
<pre><code>$ vagrant ssh
$ cd sample_app
$ rails s
</code></pre>
<p>Visit http://localhost:3000/ in your browser and you should see the welcome page for Michael Hartl’s popular <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Rails Tutorial</a>. If there are any problems then open a GitHub Issue on the <a href="https://github.com/rubynortheast/dibirails/issues">dibirails repository</a> and we’ll try and work through it with you.</p>

<h4>Text Editor</h4>
<p>The Rails community eschew IDEs in favour of text-editors. The most popular editors are <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> and <a href="http://macromates.com/">Textmate</a>. For this course we recommend <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a>. It works the same across Mac, Windows, and Linux, and has an unlimited trial.</a>
