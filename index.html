        <h3>Introduction.</h3>

<p>Welcome to the course material for the DIBI 2012 Workshop, Introduction to Ruby on Rails. This contains a handy setup guide, to be completed before the day of the workshop, a run through of some of the important concepts that will be covered, and links off to external resources that are useful for more information and may go into a little more depth.</p>

<h3>0. Setup a Rails Development Environment</h3>

<p>Setting up your environment can be difficult when beginning Ruby on Rails. There‘s a lot to take on board before you even get started. To make things easy for you, and to ensure that you have everything you need to follow along with the workshop, we have created a Virtual Machine image with the correct setup using popular, open-source tools. You’ll need to download VirtualBox and Vagrant so that you can use our Vagrant Box at the workshop.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">Download VirtualBox 4.1.12</a> for your platform and install it.</li>
  <li><a href="http://downloads.vagrantup.com/tags/v1.0.2">Download Vagrant 1.0.2</a> for your platform and install it.<br>More detailed instructions are available in the <a href="http://vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/index.html">Vagrant Documentation</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Doing It Yourself</h4>
<p>If you’re a little more experienced and want to set up a Rails development environment natively, then we can recommend the JumpstartLab <a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/environment/environment.html">Environment Setup</a> (all platforms) or the Thoughtbot <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop">Laptop Script</a> (Mac OSX only). We’re using Ruby 1.9.3 and Rails 3.1.1 on the day, but anything from Ruby 1.9.2 and Rails 3.1 upwards will be fine. Have a look at how we <a href="ubuntu_setup.html">setup Ubuntu</a> for the workshop.

<h4>Text Editor</h4>
<p>The Rails community eschew IDEs in favour of text-editors. The most popular editors are <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> and <a href="http://macromates.com/">Textmate</a>. For this course we recommend <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a> because it works the same across Mac, Windows, and Linux, and has an unlimited trial.</a>
